    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p>

        As Sol, a student embarking on the journey of
         pursuing a Bachelor's in Business Information Technology
          (BBIT), my path is illuminated by the promise of innovation 
          and the quest for knowledge. Like the sun at the center of
           the solar system, I strive to radiate warmth and light in my 
           academic pursuits, seeking to illuminate the complexities of 
           technology and its applications in the business world. With each
            course and lecture, I absorb information like the sun's rays, fueling
             my curiosity and driving me forward in my educational journey. As Sol, I am not just a student, but a beacon of determination, ready to shine brightly and make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and business.
